    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        What is the source of the download data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI provides download records as a publicly available dataset on Google's BigQuery. You can access the data
        with a Google Cloud account <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:pypi.downloads">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        When is the website data updated?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The data update begins at 01:00:00 UTC and should take about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are there so many more downloads after July 26, 2018?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI download records are generated by a service known as <a
            href="https://github.com/pypa/linehaul">linehaul</a>. The previous iteration of the service had an issue
        which caused it to restart regularly due to running out of memory, resulting in a large quantity of dropped
        download records. On July 26, a newer version of the service was deployed, which is much more robust and
        reliable.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are the cumulative download counts different from the sum of the downloads from the <i>overall</i> chart?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The cumulative download counts consider only the download records which are not from a known set of PyPI mirror
        applications, namely <code>bandersnatch</code>, <code>z3c.pypimirror</code>, <code>Artifactory</code>, and
        <code>devpi</code>. In other words, the cumulative download counts take the sum of the downloads from the
        <i>Without_Mirrors</i> dataset from the chart.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What is the difference between <i>Without_Mirrors</i> and <i>With_Mirrors</i> downloads?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <b>With_Mirrors</b> and <b>Without_Mirrors</b> downloads are not mutually exclusive sets of download counts
        like the other segmentations provided. In fact, the <b>Without_Mirrors</b> downloads are a subset of the
        downloads in <b>With_Mirrors</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some entities will create a mirror, or clone, of the PyPI repository using a tool like <a
            href="{{ url_for('general.package_page', package='bandersnatch') }}">bandersnatch</a>
        for the sake of security or availability. This means that their mirror repository regularly syncs with PyPI by
        downloading all of the Python packages available (and versions thereof) that it does not already have. Those
        downloads are recorded by PyPI with <code>bandersnatch</code> as the user-agent. You will see also that on days
        in which you release a new version of your package there will be many more downloads from mirrors, as active
        mirrors will sync with PyPI by downloading those new releases.
    </p>
    <p>
        pypistats.org filters downloads from known mirrors from the version and system segmentations on the website.
        Downloads by mirrors are intentionally excluded from download breakdowns because they do not
        represent end-users of the software. Instead, they serve as an alternative provider to <i>other</i> end-users on
        a separate (sometimes private) network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The existence of mirrors means that the downloads provided by PyPI and BigQuery come with some uncertainty with
        respect to the actual aggregate usage of Python packages. One might expect that mirrors will mask end-user
        downloads for more commonly used packages while simultaneously inflating the download counts of less common
        ones. This uncertainty is difficult to quantify because the mirrors don't report subsequent downloads back to
        PyPI.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can, however, assume that PyPI serves a significant proportion of the Python community's packaging
        downloads. Hopefully significant enough that the quantities provided here are representative of their users and
        relevant to package maintainers. There are other distributors, like Conda, which also serve python packages,
        but their download data is currently not publicly available at the event level like PyPI's, and thus are not
        incorporated into the metrics on this website.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why disregard mirrors from aggregate data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The intent of disregarding mirrors is to provide metrics that reflect end-user download aggregation.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What about downloads due to CI/CD tools?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Downloads from CI/CD tools are included in all metrics. There is currently no easy way to attribute downloads to
        build/deployment tools.
